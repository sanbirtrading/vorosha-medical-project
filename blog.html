          <h2>What makes a relationship positive and healthy?</h2>
          <p class="fst-italic" style="text-align: justify; letter-spacing: 1px;">
            A positive and healthy relationship can be shared between any two people who love, support,
            encourage and help each other practically as well as emotionally. In no particular order, people
            in healthy and positive relationships tend to: listen to each other, communicate openly and
            without any judgment. When someone experiences a positive emotional connection with their
            partner, they feel positive and happy. A strong positive and healthy relationship is built on three
            C’s: communication, compromise and lastly commitment. All these issues set of qualities are much needed in a relationship. For a positive and healthy
            relationship these are quite important to look at. <a href="https://www.helpguide.org/articles/relationships-communication/relationship-help.htm">https://www.helpguide.org/articles/relationships-communication/relationship-help.htm</a> Let’s talk in detail about these three
            C’s

              <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle"></i> <span style="font-weight: bolder;">1) Communication:</span>
                Think about how to use communication to make your partner feel needed, desired and
                appreciated. Communication is verbal and non-verbal, so actions speak volumes, and remember
                that listening is a major component of positive and healthy communication. It’s not always what
                is said, but how it is said, that’s important.</li>
              <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle"></i> <span style="font-weight: bolder;">2) Compromise:</span>
                Two people in a relationship bring individual experiences, thoughts, behaviors and personalities
                to the table. Finding common ground means expressing opinions, understanding and accepting
                differences and agreeing on compromise. This type mentality will bring peace on mind and will
                make the relationship positive and healthy. If both people feel heard and understood, it helps
                prevent one person from feeling like they’re giving in, which can build resentment over time..</li>
              <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle"></i><span style="font-weight: bolder;"> 3) Commitment:</span>
                Commitment means putting each other and the relationship first. This requires a lot of giving,
                and certainly some sacrifice, but the payoff is a relationship that brings true joy and fulfillment to
                each other’s lives. Knowing that each person is committed to working through challenges and
                growing together builds trust and intimacy, and helps release the fears and doubts that hold
                couples back.</li>

          <h2 style="line-height: 40px;">What is panic attack in general? What are the causes of panic attack and what are the
            symptoms’ involved in panic attack?</h2>
          <p style="line-height: 35px;">A panic attack is a sudden episode of intense fear that triggers severe physical reactions when
            there is no real danger or apparent cause. Panic attacks can be very frightening. When panic
            attacks occur, you might think you&#39;re losing control, having a heart attack or even dying.
            Many people have just one or two panic attacks in their lifetimes, and the problem goes away,
            perhaps when a stressful situation ends. But if you&#39;ve had recurrent, unexpected panic attacks
            and spent long periods in constant fear of another attack, you may have a condition called panic
            disorder.</p>

                  <li>Feeling of unreality or detachment</li>
                <br>
                  One of the worst things about panic attacks is the intense fear that you&#39;ll have another one. You
may fear having panic attacks so much that you avoid certain situations where they may occur.

                  It&#39;s not known what causes panic attacks or panic disorder, but these factors may play a role:
                  <li>Genetics</li>
                  <li>Major stress</li>
                  <li>Temperament that is more sensitive to stress or prone to negative emotions</li>
                  <li>Certain changes in the way parts of your brain function</li> <br>
Panic attacks may come on suddenly and without warning at first, but over time, they&#39;re usually
triggered by certain situations.
Some research suggests that your body&#39;s natural fight-or-flight response to danger is involved in
panic attacks. For example, if a grizzly bear came after you, your body would react instinctively.
Your heart rate and breathing would speed up as your body prepared for a life-threatening
situation. Many of the same reactions occur in a panic attack. But it&#39;s unknown why a panic
attack occurs when there&#39;s no obvious danger present. <br> <br>

                <h3>What are the signs of an unhealthy relationship ?</h3>
                <p class="fst-italic">Relationship is the connection between two people or things. Every relationship is important in a
                  person’s life. Communication is the most important part of a relationship. The more we communicate,
                  understand and sacrifice and try to understand each other, the more the relationship gets in a positive
                  shape. When there is communication gap or when someone communicates in aggression or in abusive
                  language then slowly it turns into an unhealthy relationship. There are types of behavior that turns a
                  relationship into a toxic, unhealthy relationship. Those behaviors are given below:</p>
                <img src="assets/img/rlsn.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                <p>1) Lack of communication <br>
                  2) Lack of Trust <br>
                  3) Feeling insecure in the relationship <br>
                  4) Abusive behavior <br>
                  5) The conflict and arguments just keep popping up <br>
                  6) The focus in on changing the other person <br>
                  7) Your partner doesn’t seem interested when you experience success, or they belittle your success <br>
                  8) The other “C” word: &quot;Crazy.&quot; If you call each other &quot;crazy&quot; during arguments, it’s a pretty bad sign. It
                  shows that you’re no longer willing to listen to each other’s point of view because you’ve written it off
                  as irrational. <br>
                  9) When you argue, it quickly escalates to ultimatums or threats—&quot;If you don&#39;t ..., I&#39;ll ...&quot; <br>
                  10) Your partner is coercive when it comes to sex. <br>
                  11) You feel lonely when you’re together. <br>
                  12)You’re very critical of each other, and you feel constantly nitpicked about the ways you’re not “good

                <h3>What are the alternative treatments for anxiety?</h3>
                <p class="fst-italic">Some anxiety is just a normal part of human life. It’s very much common in today’s often-
                  Chaotic world. Anxiety is not that bad because it keeps you awake of danger, motivates you to
                  stay well organized and prepared and helps you to calculate the risks and to take steps by which a
                  person can avoid risks in life. Unchecked Anxiety may result in very bad way in our quality of
                  life. Alternative therapies can be helpful in reducing anxiety, but it may take some time before
                  you see results. If you’re having a panic attack or other severe symptoms of anxiety, alternative
                  therapy alone probably will not be enough. Alternative therapies often work best when used
                  along with traditional treatment, such as medication and counseling. It’s always suggested and
                  advised to consult with Psychiatrists, Psychologist and counseling experts before beginning an
                  alternative treatment program.
                  
                  Here are some alternative treatments that can help with anxiety: </p>
                <img src="assets/img/anxiety.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                <p>1) Limit your caffeine intake: That morning cup of coffee might help you get out of bed, but
                  having too much can give you the jitters and decrease your ability to handle anxiety well. It can
                  also cause your body to act as though it’s under stress, boosting your heartbeat and increasing
                  your blood pressure. This can lead to a panic attack. <br><br>
                  
                  2) Avoid alcohol and nicotine: Some people use alcohol and nicotine to relieve their symptoms
                  of anxiety. This relief is only temporary. Alcohol and nicotine can make the symptoms of
                  anxiety worse and more frequent.<br><br>
                  
                  3) Eat a balanced diet: It’s important to maintain a balanced diet whether or not you’re
                  experiencing anxiety. Try to eat a wide variety of fresh, whole foods every day. Eating healthy
                  food makes you feel better. Avoid processed or fast food and limit your intake of sweets. Eating
                  unhealthy food adds stress to your body. This makes you less able to handle the other stresses in
                  your life. <br><br>
                  
                  4) Drink more water: Seventy percent of the body’s weight is water. Water is the essential
                  component of a healthy body and mind, and we often don’t get enough of it. Drinking eight to
                  eleven large glasses of water or other hydrating liquids per day helps your body perform
                  properly. This can help relieve stress. <br><br>
                  
                  5) Get regular exercise: Getting regular exercise is good for relieving stress. Cardiovascular
                  exercise has been shown to help lower stress levels and anxiety, and improve the immune
                  system. Cardiovascular exercise means getting your heart rate up for 30 minutes. Developing a
                  regular exercise routine can help you feel more in control of your health, which can also reduce
                  your anxiety. <br><br>
                  
                  6) Get plenty of sleep: A lack of sleep can increase negative thoughts and can place extra stress
                  on the brain and body. Try to get at least seven to nine hours of quality sleep every night. If you
                  have trouble sleeping, try to support your body’s natural sleep schedule by: <br><br>
                  
                  * going to sleep and waking up at the same time each day <br>
                  * taking only short naps for 15 to 20 minutes in the early afternoon if you need to <br>
                  
                  * exposing yourself to bright sunlight in the morning, spending more time outside during
                  the day in natural light <br>
                  * avoiding bright screens one to two hours before bed and making sure you sleep in a
                  darkened, cool room <br>
                  * getting regular exercise <br><br>
                  
                  7) Practice deep breathing: Shallow, fast breathing is common with anxiety. It may lead to a
                  fast heart rate, dizziness or lightheadedness, or even a panic attack. Deep breathing exercises—
                  the deliberate process of taking slow, even, deep breaths — can help restore normal breathing
                  patterns and reduce anxiety. <br><br>
                  
                  8) Try aromatherapy: Aromatherapy uses fragrant essential oils to promote health and well-
                  being. The oils may be inhaled directly or added to a warm bath or diffuser. Studies have shown
                  that aromatherapy: <br><br>
                  
                  * helps you relax <br>
                  * helps you sleep <br>
                  * boosts mood <br>
                  * reduces heart rate and blood pressure <br>
                  
                  9) Meditation: A main goal of meditation is to remove chaotic thoughts from your mind and
                  replace them with a sense of calm and mindfulness of the present moment. Meditation is known
                  for relieving stress and anxiety. Research from John Hopkins suggests 30 minutes of daily
                  meditation may alleviate some anxiety symptoms and act as an antidepressant. <br><br>
                  
                  10) Talk to someone: Tell friends and family you’re feeling overwhelmed, and let them know
                  how they can help you. Talk to a physician or therapist for professional help. <br> <br>
                  
                  Avoiding anxiety may not always be possible in our day to day life, especially when you need to
                  keep a constant balance between your workplace and personal life. These are some simple ways
                  to turn down the anxiety from an individual’s day to day life. If you are feeling devastated due to
                  your troubles in day to day life then free to contact Vorosha Mental health Service where your
                  issues will be taken care by the expert mental health therapists in a very cost-effective way. <br>

              <h3>What is mental health? Why mental health is important? What are the early warning
                signs of someone having problem with their mental health?</h3>
              <p class="fst-italic">Mental health includes our emotional, psychological and social well-being. It affects how we
                think about a certain issue and how we act to the issue based on situation. It also helps us to
                determine how we will handle stress and how we will make choice over time. Mental health is
                important in every stage of our life from the early childhood to the ultimate stage of our life.
                Suicide rate increase when mental health is neglected so we can understand how much important
                mental is in our life. <br>
                There are three main reasons why mental health is so important:</p>
              <img src="assets/img/mental-health-day-human-profile-brain-gears-psychology-medical-treatment-free-vector.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
              <p>1)Mental Health Affects Physical Health : Mental illness matters just as much as any disease,
                and it can take one’s life as easily as any other. The mind and the body are connected. Many
                mental ailments cause stress, which lowers the immune system. This means more frequent
                sickness and inability to cope. Stress and anxiety can take a toll on our physical health.
                According to WebMD, “worry causes the body to release stress hormones that speed up your
                heart rate and breathing, raise your blood sugar, and send more blood to your arms and legs.
                Over time, this can affect your heart, blood vessels, muscles, and other systems. After affecting
                the body the body slowly starts to shut down and that’s when physical health totally gets
                collapsed. <br> <br>
                2)End Stigma and Shame to Lead Better Lives : It’s better to talk about mental health so that
                people can come forward and help. Mental health is a normal issue and we should not feel
                ashamed or broken if we face any mental problems. We should always be positive and we should
                talk more about the problems and then the problems will be smaller with less hold on our lives. <br> <br>
                3) Mental Health Affects Everything: Mental health basically affects everything. Our mental
                health affects how we cope with life. Lack of treatment leads to issues like anxiety, fear,
                worthlessness, sadness and lastly loss of control in life. It might then affect our relationship, our
                decision making capability, self-harm and lastly professional failure might happen due to lack of
                concentration. <br> <br>
                
                The early warning signs an individual might find when they feel they have some mental health
                problems. Experiencing one or more of the following feelings or behaviors can be an early
                warning sign of a problem: <br>
                1) Eating or sleeping too much or too little <br>
                2) Pulling away from people and usual activities<br>
                3) Having low or no energy<br>
                4) Feeling numb or like nothing matters<br>
                5) Having unexplained aches and pains<br>
                6) Feeling helpless or hopeless<br>
                7) Smoking, drinking, or using drugs more than usual<br>
                8) Feeling unusually confused, forgetful, on edge, angry, upset, worried, or scared<br>
                9) Yelling or fighting with family and friends<br>
                10) Experiencing severe mood swings that cause problems in relationships<br>
                11) Having persistent thoughts and memories you can&#39;t get out of your head<br>
                12) Hearing voices or believing things that are not true<br>
                13) Thinking of harming yourself or others<br>
                14) Inability to perform daily tasks like taking care of your kids or getting to work or
                school<br><br>
                
                Quality mental health care requires specialized mental health professionals. If you are facing any
                of the warning signs mentioned above in your life you can talk with us more counseling. For

              <h3>What are the tips for new parents to remain stressed-free?</h3>
              <p class="fst-italic">A new born can bring the ultimate joy to a family. It is a situation when the parents tend to live
                their everything for the sake of their baby. They forget about their regular life just to be in side of
                their babies. Whether you&#39;re a first-time parent or a veteran, consider 10 practical tips to keep
                stress under control. <br>
                1. Take care of yourself: Eat a healthy diet and take care of your health along with
                babies. Try to sleep with the baby and try to work out for some time when you get time
                throughout the whole day.<br>
                2. Establish visiting rules: Try to establish a time when the visitors can visit your baby.
                Let them insist to wash hands and handle baby with utmost care and also strictly avoid
                anyone who is ill if they want to visit your baby.<br>
                
                3. Go with the flow: Allow plenty of time each day for nursing sessions, naps and crying
                spells. When you need to head out, give yourself extra time to pack your supplies and
                make that inevitable last minute diaper change.<br>
                4. Expect a bunch of emotions: A bunch of emotions might sometime bother you.
                You might be tired due to sleepless night so try to communicate with your partner so that
                he supports you.<br>
                5. Relax your standards: Keep the house neat and clean up to the mark based on your
                free time. Don’t hurry on doing chores to complete. It will create extra hassle but make
                sure you keep the house surroundings clean. <br></p>

              <p>6. Get out of the house: If you are enough stressed try to go out with the baby for a fresh

                walk in the park which will be soothing at times and will make you fresh. <br>
                7. Accept a helping hand: Accepting a helping maid is necessary if you are finding it
                tough to complete work by own. You should appoint a helping hand who can support
                you for works.<br>
                8. Nurture other relationships: Your newborn needs your love and attention, but you
                won&#39;t let your baby down by spending time with others. If you have other children, set
                aside one-on-one time with each of them. Schedule dates with your partner. Meet a
                friend for lunch or movies.<br>
                9. Keep your perspective: The newborn days won&#39;t last long. Step back and appreciate the
                moment, even amid the chaos.<br>
                10. Know when to seek additional help: Parenting is a challenge, even on a good day. If
                
                You’re depressed or you&#39;re having trouble adjusting to life with a newborn, consult with
                mental health provider who can guide you well.<br><br>

              <h3>What is will power? What are the ways to increase will power?</h3>
              <p class="fst-italic">Will power is the stimulation to practice will. A person with strong and much will power will not
                return back even if it is the toughest situation or if there is a strong competitor. On the other hand
                a person with little willpower will give up easily. In summary it can be said that Will power is
                the ability to employ strong determination which allows you to perform something difficult and
                tough.</p>
              <img src="assets/img/i_can_do_it_scissors.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
              <p>If you want to get what you want then you will have to have strong willpower. You must be
                determined and should do what it takes to achieve the destination. Will and power are closely
                connected, as using will is employing power. Powerful and strong people often exercise what
                seems to be a strong will, although this often comes from the confidence that having power
                creates rather than directly from having the power. <br> <br>
                
                Will power tends to be stronger over time if you are working relentlessly over your own goals
                in a planned way. <br> <br>
                
                The best ways to increase willpower are: <br> <br>
                
                1) Don’t take on things a lot at once. <br>
                2) Plan ahead in a structured way <br>

              <h3>What is work burn out? Why work burn out happens and how to deal with it?</h3>
              <p class="fst-italic">Work burn out is a state of physical and emotional fatigue that involves a state of physical and
                emotional exhaustion that also involves a sense of reduced accomplishment and loss of personal
                identity which eventually creates dissatisfaction in an individual’s work life and that individual
                eventually feels it tough to concentrate on the job in the long run. <br> <br>
                
                The reasons of work burn out are: <br> <br>
                1) Lack of control. An inability to influence decisions that affect your job — such as
                your schedule, assignments or workload — could lead to job burnout. So could a lack of
                the resources you need to do your work. <br> <br>
                2) Unclear job expectations. If you&#39;re unclear about the degree of authority you have or
                what your supervisor or others expect from you, you&#39;re not likely to feel comfortable at
                work. <br> <br>
                3) Dysfunctional workplace dynamics. Perhaps you work with an office bully, or you
                feel undermined by colleagues or your boss micromanages your work. This can
                contribute to job stress. <br> <br>
                4) Extremes of activity. When a job is monotonous or chaotic, you need constant energy
                to remain focused — which can lead to fatigue and job burnout. <br> <br>
                5) Lack of social support. If you feel isolated at work and in your personal life, you
                might feel more stressed. <br> <br>
                6) Work-life imbalance. If your work takes up so much of your time and effort that you
                don&#39;t have the energy to spend time with your family and friends, you might burn out
                quickly .</p>
              <img src="assets/img/-burnout-on-your-team.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
              <p>There are few ways we can deal job burnout: <br> <br>

                1) Evaluate your options: Discuss can be done with supervisor regarding what can be
                done to get the ultimate result. Different options can be used to find the ultimate work
                done.<br> <br>
                
                2) Seek support: Employee assistance program can be a great support for to discuss
                about the problems someone is facing regarding his / her job and how to deal with it.<br> <br>
                
                3) Exploring relaxing activity: Yoga and meditation related things can make mind
                fresh and sound and to start with a new spirit.<br> <br>
                
                4) Get some sleep. Sleep restores well-being and helps protect your health.<br> <br>
                
                5) Mindfulness. Mindfulness is the act of focusing on your breath flow and being
                intensely aware of what you&#39;re sensing and feeling at every moment, without
                interpretation or judgment. In a job setting, this practice involves facing situations
                with openness and patience, and without judgment.<br> <br>

                1) Acute trauma: Acute trauma is reason of a single distressing event like: rape, assault,
                car accident, child abuse, national disaster climate change etc. It often creates a long
                term negative impression on the persons mind. <br> <br>
                2) Chronic trauma : Chronic trauma is reason of multiple traumatic events which lasts for
                a long term and create impacts in negative way in human’s life which lately causes

              <p>3) Complex trauma: Complex trauma is similar to chronic trauma with a few differences.
                It involves multiple, chronic traumatic events, but these events are always prolonged.
                These events almost always occur within an interpersonal relationship, which causes
                internal conflict for the survivor. Long-term sexual and domestic violence can contribute
                to complex trauma. <br> <br>
                The common trauma symptoms include the following: <br>
                1) Shame and guilt <br>
                2) Hopelessness and numbness <br>
                3) Excessive sweating <br>
                
                4) A constant state of alertness <br>

              <h3>What is Co-parenting? The do&#39;s and don&#39;ts of co-parenting well?</h3>
              <p class="fst-italic">Co-parenting is a post-divorce parenting arrangement by which both the parents jointly
                participate in their child’s demand fulfilling and upbringing in a systemic way. This involves a
                substantial amount of interaction between the parents (both in public and in private). In Co-
                parenting both the parents need to support the child and needs to work in joint to make
                everything smoother for the children.
                There are several things that need to be keeping in mind during the co-parent situation. The dos
                and don’ts of co-parenting a child are given below:</p>
              <img src="assets/img/co-parenting-logo.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
              <p>1) Commit to making co-parenting an open dialogue with your Ex: Try to make an open
                communication with your Ex. It does not have to be via phone call or face to face meet
                up rather it can be done via mail, text, and voice mail or even through letter and if you are
                comfortable via face to face meet up then also it can be done. <br> <br>
                2) Commit to positive talk around the house. Make it a rule to frown upon your children
                talking disrespectfully about your Ex even though it may be music to your ears. <br> <br>
                3) Agree on specific things even if you don’t like it : Agree on specific things even if you
                don’t like for the sake of your child and try to keep them happy. Example: If they want to
                go for a visit in a park make some time and talk with your Ex and should plan and make
                the visit happen to brighten the child’s day.<br> <br>
                4) Keep your Ex informed: Although it is quite painful but try to keep things updated
                between you and your Ex about different issues related to the child. Example: Let your
                Ex know about child’s exam time, health condition, likes , dislikes and also if there is any
                change in their behavior keep them updated between you and your Ex. <br> <br>
                * Don&#39;ts <br> <br>
                1) Don’t jump into conclusion with your Ex: When you hear things from your children
                that make you bristle, take a breath and remain quiet. Remember that any negative
                comments your children make are often best taken with a grain of salt. It&#39;s always good to
                remain neutral when things like this happen. Research shows that your child can learn to
                resent and distrust you if you cheer them on.<br> <br>
                
                2) Don’t be an unbalanced parent: Be a balanced person for the sake of the child. Don’t
                let the child understand the problems between you and your Ex and never shout in front
                of them even if you don’t like any behavior by your Ex.<br> <br>
                3) Don’t accuse each other: Don’t accuse each other for mistakes or issues that related to
                the child. Try to handle things with care and love and show responsibility to each other.
                Rather than accusing each other try to build a strong bonding with the child and don’t
                ever complain about anything to your child regarding your Ex , you have to remember he/
                she may be your Ex but still he/she is a father or mother to the child.<br> <br>
                4) Don’t burden your child: Don’t burden you child with negativity and cruelty. Positivity
                should be practiced in all forms and aspects of life and especially in front of children.
                If you believe you are experiencing symptoms that is creating problem in your co-
                parenting try to seek help from our mental health practitioner at Vorosha Mental health

              <h3>What is anger management? What are the best possible ways to overcome anger?</h3>
              <p class="fst-italic" >Anger management is the system by which an individual understand that he is getting angry at
                things so he needs to take action to calm down him in a positive productive way in order to live
                peacefully. It is a fact that anger affects physical health. According to Yale University People
                with anger management issues tends to get sick more often and also immune system gets weaker.
                Anger also leads to coronary disease and lastly high blood pressure issues so anger management
                is an important issue that needs to be taken care in order to lead a healthy and happy life.
                
                When you let anger bubble away, it can cause an eruption. This can cause someone to be unable
                to think in a clear way and also can damage your relationship and you become unable to have
                trust on people. It can be said that overcoming anger is very much important to lead a normal
                life. The best possible ways to overcome anger are given below:</p>
              <img src="assets/img/anger-management-.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
              <p>1) Recognize the warning signs: When you are angry your heart rate rises rapidly and you
                start to breathe faster so an individual needs to be vigilant to deal with the matters before
                they build up. <br> <br>
                2) Have a “time-out”: Avoid “leaping in” with an angry response. We need to calm our
                self-down by counting to 10 before even you act. <br> <br>
                3) Catch your breath: We need to try to slow our breathing process. This will help us to be
                calm and quiet and we will be able to think clearly.<br> <br>
                4) Regular exercise is a must: Regular exercise will improve our state of mind and will
                make us less minded to anger.<br> <br>
                5) Finding some quiet time: Finding some quiet time will help us to concentrate and think
                deeply. It will help us to control our anger and will help us to think in deep to understand
                what to do and what not to do. Mindfulness or centering are some techniques which will
                make us relaxed and calm and quiet and will help us to cope with stress over the longer
                term.<br> <br>
                
                6) Avoiding Alcohol: Alcohol makes mind hyper and person gets angry easily without
                thinking anything. We should avoid alcohol for the betterment of our health and also to
                keep mind fresh.<br> <br>
                7) Express our emotion: We need to express our emotion otherwise frustration will rise up
                when we will keep thing inside. We need to talk with our friends and family about our
                emotions and it will make us feel free inside.<br> <br>
                8) Let it go: We need to let things go even if we find it unfair. If we can make this practice
                then we will be able to move past bitterness and past grudges and can feel peace deep
                inside our mind and brain.<br> <br>
                If you feel you are failing to control your anger then it is important to seek help from
                mental practitioners as soon as possible. They will help you to find a way out to control
                your anger as much as possible. <br> <br> <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/anger-

              <h3>Why Suicide is never the solution to any problem?</h3>
              <p class="fst-italic">Suicide means ending your own life. The idea of suicide comes to mind when an individual
                thinks that he/she will not be able to cope with the pain and suffering he had in life. A bunch of
                thought will come to an individual’s mind like : He/ she might think his/ her life is of no use,
                They are the ultimate loser, unlucky in life, not successful in anything that individual did and
                lastly he/she might also think no one loves him/her and no one in society do care for that
                individual. These mundane thoughts gradually pop up in human mind that attempt or try to
                commit suicide. Every human being will taste death which is a fact of human life but attempting
                suicide or ending life is never a solution. Suicide is not a solution of anything. It proves that
                individual is coward and selfish person who doesn’t care about them also they don’t care about
                his/ her family and beloved ones. However, suicide is a temporary solution to your problems at
                the cost of your life permanently. There are some positive and permanent solutions too that you
                need to look out for. The solutions to looks after are:</p>
              <img src="assets/img/suicide1.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
              <p>1) Every problem has a solution: It is a fact when there is a problem there is surely
                solution of it. We need to think deeply, concentrate on the matter, trust on you and handle
                the matter with patience. Life is precious and it is our utmost responsibility to fight back
                every up and down in life with whole heart. <br> <br>
                2) Things get change by time: Time is biggest player of all. It heals and changes
                everything. This too shall pass and all we need to do is to stay alert and recognize the
                solution and work on that.<br> <br>
                3) There is always a second option: There is never one single solution to another problem.
                There is always option, we just need to look for and need to capitalize on that.<br> <br>
                4) Avoid your thoughts, focus more on facts: Emotion plays a vital part in our life. It gets
                heavier on mind and influences a lot. But during problems and issues we need to be
                logical and practical and we need to leave no stones unturned and no facts unchecked.
                We need to get to the facts rather than thinking differently based on mind.<br> <br>
                5) You have never seen the future: You might be suffering for so long with your
                problems and might have lost the confidence in life but it is a fact that future never can be
                predicted with 100 % certainty. Let’s go with the flow and by gradually things will get
                better for sure.<br> <br>
                
                6) Life is one and there is no turning back once gone: We live once and every life is
                precious. The issues you might be facing might get solved by other means but once you
                are gone you are gone and there is no turning back to life. Just think about your family
                and loved ones they will surely not live the happy again without you. It’s better to
                confront, than to repent being a helpless soul.<br> <br>
                7) Death is not the permanent solution
                You are so fed up that you committed suicide. But your problem might have stopped
                chasing you, but it will find its new victim. And there goes the chain reaction of suicidal
                attempts. What’s the value of killing yourself? But, if you would have faced it, solved it
                you might have been a role model or an example to encourage and influence others in
                troubles.<br> <br>
                So it will be a request to everyone to think about your problems in 360 degree angle and
                think logically not emotionally. Every life is precious and live your life like a real brave
                and bold person and face everything in life. If you are having different things in life
                which is turning worst day by day feel free to talk with your mental health practitioners at

              <h3>What do you understand by the term Paranoia? What are the symptoms involved in
                Paranoia? What is the diagnosis way of Paranoia?</h3>
              <p class="fst-italic">Paranoia is the irrational and continuous feeling that “people are against you and trying to harm
                you and create conspiracy against you. This unfounded mistrust of others can make it difficult
                for a person with paranoia to function socially or to maintain close relationship with others.
                As an example it can be said: someone once said something against you to another person you
                know so now you think that he is doing the same thing against you and directing a hate campaign
                against you so that everyone hates you believing in what he said about you.</p>
              <img src="assets/img/causes-of-paranoia.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
              <p>Paranoid symptoms may range from mild to severe. They depend on the cause but, generally, a
                person who is paranoid might have symptoms like these: <br> <br>
                
                1) The person might get offended very easily without understanding the issue in a cool
                headed way. <br>
                2) The person might have issue with trust and he might not be able trust other people easily. <br>
                3) Be always on the defensive. <br>
                4) Not be able to compromise anything that he goes through. <br>
                5) Not been able to confide in anyone. <br>
                6) The person might consider the world to be a threat and against him. <br>
                7) The person might be aggressive so easily and try to argue on every little issue he faces in
                life. <br>
                8) The person might think people are talking behind his back to down grade him to others. <br>
                9) He might not be been able to cope constructive criticism. <br>
                10) The person might always be thinking of conspiracy theories. <br><br>
                
                All these are the issues and warning signs that take in the first place when someone gets in
                with Paranoia. <br> <br>
                
                There is also diagnosis of Paranoia. The diagnosis ways are: <br>
                1)To check the medical history of the person <br>
                2) Physical examination to understand his actual state <br>
                3) Assessment of symptoms <br>
                4) Psychological tests <br>
                5) Tests to rule out other psychiatric disorders that may be causing the symptoms. <br> <br>
                
                Sometimes Paranoia turns into serious mental illness and creates a huge problem in his day to
